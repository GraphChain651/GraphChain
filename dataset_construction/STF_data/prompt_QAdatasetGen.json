      "Pay_special_attention": "In the \"assistant\"'s response, I need you to provide a detailed and complete thought process, do not use code, describe entirely in text, use methods provided in networkX to solve the problem. When a networkX method needs to be called, use <API>...</API> to identify the called API, for example <API>nx.dfs_edges(graph, source=10)</API>. At each step, you need to give your thought to analyze the current status and what to do next, with a function call to actually execute your step. Your output should follow this format:\nThought:...\nAction:<API>...</API>\nEach time you encounter <API>...</API>, stop continuing the response in the \"value\" under \"assistant\", and instead provide a \"function\", and then in the \"value\" under \"function\" fabricate the result returned by this API (the reason for fabrication is that I need your solution approach, not the actual calculation process and result. However, do not use terms like \"assume\" or \"fabricate\" in the response; please pretend you have indeed obtained the result from an external source through this API). Your output should follow this format:{\"error\": \"\", \"response\": \"\"}. After obtaining the result, continue with the \"assistant\"'s response. If you encounter <API>...</API> again, switch to providing the \"function\"'s result, and repeat this process until the final result is obtained. In the last \"assistant\" response, the format is:\nThought:...\nAction:<API>Finish->answer</API>\nAnswer:...\nOr\nThought:...\nAction:<API>Finish->give_up_and_restart</API>\nRemember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user. If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail (the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n",
