Directed edge A->B means  that A has transferred funds to B.\nThe graph construction operation is:\nG = nx.MultiDiGraph()\nG.add_edge(sender, receiver, weight=amount, date=transfer_date)\nwhere \"sender\" and \"receiver\" are the sender and receiver of the transfer, \"amount\" is the amount of money, and \"transfer_date\" is the date of the transfer.The integer type is used to store nodes when constructing the graph."

  "what you need to do": {
    "task": "There is currently a multi-step mechanism for solving graph problems. You are an engineer who generates the execution code for each step. Since the graph we need to analyze has a very large number of nodes, this mechanism always maintains a global dictionary object named \"lastStepResult\". This dictionary object stores the analysis results obtained in the previous step, and the next step will read this dictionary object to continue the operation. You need to generate the code required for the current step based on the \"input\" content. This code needs to be able to read \"lastStepResult\" (the reading method is based on \"the_structure_of_dict\" in \"the_specification_of_thisStepResult\"), then solve the current step's problem based on \"lastStepResult\", and finally store the solved result in \"thisStepResult\" (I will use \"thisStepResult\" later to update \"lastStepResult\" to help the next step), and provide the usage method, dictionary structure, etc. of \"thisStepResult\". The \"input\" will contain three parts: (1) the user's original question (user_question); (2) the usage method, dictionary structure, etc. of \"lastStepResult\" obtained in the previous step (the_specification_of_lastStepResult); (3) what needs to be done in this step (this_step_demand). If \"the_specification_of_theStepResult\" is FirstStepNotheStepResult, it means it is the first step. You need to read the graph object I have constructed using G = nx.read_gexf(gexf_file_path), directly use G to write code to solve this first step problem, and store the result in \"thisStepResult\". If \"the_specification_of_theStepResult\" has specific content, it means it is a subsequent step. You need to read \"lastStepResult\" and solve the current step's problem based on it, and store the result in \"thisStepResult\".",
    "output_type": "python",
    "output_rules": "(1)the function body should be a python code and there must be nothing in the python code but this function body and elaborate code annotations. No use example needed.",
    "Pay_special_attention": "(1)The return value of the function which I need you generate must be a dictionary. (2)The result must be a dictionary followed this format:{\"thisStepResult\": \"\",\"the_specification_of_thisStepResult\": {\"the_structure_of_dict\": \"\",\"the_description_of_content\": \"\", \"how_to_use\": \"\"}} (3)Note that I have already constructed the graph object using G = nx.read_gexf(gexf_file_path). If it is the first step, you can use it directly. (4)Note that you only need to complete one step in the multi-step mechanism, do not completely solve the problem \"user_question\", do not completely solve \"user_question\". The code generated this time only solves \"this_step_demand\", the code generated this time only solves \"this_step_demand\". I will continue to do the next step based on your results later. (5)You can only read \"lastStepResult\" according to the_specification_of_lastStepResult, you cannot create a dictionary yourself. (6)Pay special attention to the utilization of \"lastStepResult\". For example, if \"lastStepResult\" stores a list of directed cycles, then you should read \"lastStepResult\" when you need to use the list of directed cycles, instead of recalculating it from scratch."
